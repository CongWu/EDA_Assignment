EDA_Assignment

JS Datascience EDA

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, 
a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 

And I do some basic EDA according the assignment requirement.

Several techniques I have learnt:
1, mfrow & mfcol plot in different order
2, use lty in legend to make it "line" and cex to change the size
3, use dev.copy(png, file = "plot4.png") 
dev.off()  to plot to a png file
4, use  strptime(time,format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S") to transform original "factor" type time. And it could plot as "Week Day")
